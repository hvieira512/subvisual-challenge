# Overview

Hi there! Here is my attempt of solving the **Subvisual Challenge**!

Overall I think I did well, even tho I am learning React by myself.
This project taught me a lot of things, how are components rendered, how does the Virtual DOM work, how to fetch data from an API, among others.

And mainly, I had fun coding it!

## Struggles
My main struggle was using useEffect since I've didn't had a lot of experience with it, but after completing this project, I got a pretty good grasp of how it works.

## Features
In terms of features, I've added a few things:

1. **Added a Preview List**: while the user is searching, a list will appear with the possible matches. Since I was already trying to compare the best matches, I saw this as an opportunity to show the user what Pok√©mon he might be trying to find.
2. **Created a Reset Button**: in case the user wants to go back to the start.

I did not complete automated tests since I did not had the time for it
